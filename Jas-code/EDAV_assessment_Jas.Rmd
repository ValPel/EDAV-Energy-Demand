#Conclusion:
#The national demand data does not follow normal distribution
#So in the following steps, let's try some transformation, to see if the data can follow normal distribution after transformation


#Used Log transformation for national_demand:
#Using qq plot:
qqnorm(log(energy_data$national_demand))
qqline(log(energy_data$national_demand), col = "red")

#Fitting Gamma Distribution:
fit_gamma <- fitdistr(energy_data$national_demand, "gamma")
print(fit_gamma)  
shape_param <- fit_gamma$estimate["shape"]
rate_param <- fit_gamma$estimate["rate"]
hist(energy_data$national_demand, probability = TRUE, col = "lightblue", breaks = 30,
     main = "Gamma Fit on National Demand", xlab = "National Demand (MW)")
curve(dgamma(x, shape = shape_param, rate = rate_param), 
      add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
ks.test(energy_data$national_demand, "pgamma", shape_param, rate_param)  #KS test 
# p-value (0.002129) from the KS test is very small (< 0.05), we reject H0. This concludes Gamma is not a good fit for the energy data

#Fitting Log Normal Distribution:
fit_lognormal <- fitdistr(energy_data$national_demand, "lognormal")
print(fit_lognormal)
meanlog <- fit_lognormal$estimate["meanlog"]
sdlog <- fit_lognormal$estimate["sdlog"]
ks.test(energy_data$national_demand, "plnorm", meanlog, sdlog) #KS test 
hist(energy_data$national_demand, probability = TRUE, col = "lightblue", breaks = 30,
     main = "Log-Normal Fit on National Demand", xlab = "National Demand (MW)")
curve(dlnorm(x, meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)
# p-value from the KS test is very small (< 0.05), we reject H0. This concludes Log-Normal is not a good fit for the energy data



```
##Conclusion:
##From the histrogram, the data appears to be right skewed, ie longer tail on the right. 
##From the qq plot, the data doesn't follow a normal distribution, based on the deviation from the extreme right and left side of the plot. 
##We did further testing on the log transformed of national demand, and from the qq plot we can see that it still doesn't fit normal distribution.
##Based on the right skewed feature of the data, we tried the following:
##1. Fitting gamma distribution, as the gamma distribution is only for positive values (X>0), and tend to be used for data that are right skewed. However, from the result for ##the KS test, we see that p-value (0.002129) from the KS test is very small (< 0.05), we reject H0. This concludes Gamma is not a good fit for the energy data

##2. Fitting Log Normal Distribution:
##Log-Normal distribution is also often used for postively skewed data.
##However from the KS test result, we reject H0. This concludes log normal is not a good fit for the energy data

##The box is the mean of the energy demdn
##We can see in both winter and autumn, there is high demand for energy
## Winter, Spring and Autmn has the largest fluctuation of the demand (showsn by the red range)

## If we compare the over trend from the decomposition graph vs the trend of the yearly mean. The decomposition graph suggest stricly decreasing demand, while the yearly mean doesn't sugget this conclusion
## The Graph did suggest seasonality
## The noise graph looks completely random, where there is no patter. 

##MA Graph:
##From the original blue grpah -> we can see that there are a lot of noise, and sudden fluctuations (could be due to sudden change / requirement of energy)
##From the red plot -> smooth out some fluctuations
##From the green plot -> smooth out more fluctuations, and shows clear seasonality
